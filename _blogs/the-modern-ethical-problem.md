<h1> THE MODERN ETHICAL PROBLEM </h1>                                          

I’m 21 years old; mentioning that gives out my experience and perspective I share. This is an argument I’ve had with myself for quite a long time. The contradicting beliefs have now resorted to a calm state. I can express that conflict of thoughts in this blog. You all know my name and this blog is purely my stand on how I see things. It could be a touchy subject for all those right-wing extremists. So Racists, Bigots, religious warlords LEAVE!

<h3>THE HARDWIRED MORAL</h3>

I’ll cut through the stories and keep it neat. As a child growing up with strict orthodox parents I was quite disciplined for a young boy. This discipline brought a belief into my head which is very plain statement that most of the people overlook. “Hard work pays off”. Right. When you work hard the reward is delightful. The skill of being hardworking individual can come in very handy. So the opposite of hard working individual is a lazy slacker. Laziness is something I hate in me and in others. Laziness is a sin Punishable by failure. And as a man, one must strive to avoid failure by all the conditions that are under his control. Failure due to external conditions is understandable but failure due to one’s own laziness, negligence is unacceptable. Laziness is the opposition of a progress in civilisation. It’s the destiny nobody should go to.   
Ø  LAZINESS IN AN INDIVIDUAL BRINGS FAILURE IN A SYSTEM OR IN A RELATIONSHIP. (1)
That’s the hardwired moral.

<h3>COLLECTIVISM</h3>

Collectivism is basically putting people in sections or groups (I refer to them as sects) based on cultural, ethnic, religion, creed, caste, color, gender (the list goes on) traits . This act of creating groups in order to rule people was done or is being done by rulers back in the history books till this day. Based on language rulers divided people into sects and united them in those sects. Based on religion they gathered majority of groups. Subjecting people to a group is an unnecessary, quite moronic act aging since Stone Age.  Sects can be found anywhere. Example: - people who smoke, people who don’t. People who get E grades, People who get straight A’s. Ask yourself this: No matter how friendly and anti-conflict you are, you belong to a sect knowingly or unknowingly.
Ø  A GROUP OF PEOPLE MAY HAVE MORE PRIVILEGES IN A SOCIETY OF CLASS STRUGGLE, THAN THE OTHER- DESTROYING OR PUSHING BACK OTHER GROUPS OR SECTS OF PEOPLE INTO THE DEPTHS. (2)

<h3>THE LEFTISTS NEED HELP</h3>

By leftists need help I mean they need help helping the abandoned groups in the process of advancing civilisation. (Refer to (2)). The abandoned civilisation needs privileges in order to push the civilisation as a whole and lead humanity. So they encapsulate the profits of the machines run by us and push them down the groups so the sects get the profits and push themselves forward. So we give them hard earned money.
Ø  THE SECT AS A WHOLE NEEDS PRIVILEGES IN ORDER TO COPE UP WITH THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SYSTEM. THE SECT ALSO NEEDS A CENTRALISED SYSTEM THAT DISTRIBUTES THE CAPSULE OF MONEY. SO THEY NEED HELP OF THOSE ABOVE THEM. (3)
THE SELFISH MAN

We don’t want to be under inspection. We never liked to be, so we don’t want a centralised body or system that governs us. We couldn’t care less about the government had it not been for the sects. But what do I care about the sects. (Refer (1)) says that laziness leads to failure but how are we sure EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THE SECT WORKS HARD SUCH THAT THEY ARE WORTHY OF THE FRUIT OF MY LABORIOUS HARD-WORK? Another problem with sects is that we completely fail to treat people as an individual in the overall process of helping them. How do we quantify hard work?
Ø  WE DON’T WANT TO THROW MONEY ON LAZY SLACKERS AND A SOCIETY THAT BEGS A CENTRALISED SYSTEM.WE WANT TO BE FREE.LIVING FOR OURSELVES.(4)

<h3>THE INNER CONFLICT<h3>

The problem is, in a purely rational perspective everyone must act as an individual, treat everyone as an individual person with individual beliefs, feelings and personalities. If we became progressive selfish beings not caring about the community then we’ll never reach the paramount of our civilisation which is important to live longer. But if we gave ourselves in to this sect activities and uniting people based on a nuance we are likely to not stop any soon. People want help in groups but beg judgement in terms of individual.  


<h3>THE SOLUTION<h3>
 
The practical solution is establish a centralised system till a say point in the distant future and eliminate these nuances and let the sects collapse into healthy individuals who identify themselves as individuals. It has to be something that needs to be lectured that always respect the idea of A PERSON over A SECT. Always describing the unimportant of the sect is a must as to destroy the sect ideology and gain complete control over one’s action, rewards and goals. It has to start of easy by helping groups the insignificance of groups contributing to community and betray the thought of laziness carrying the people in the depths of hopelessness.
